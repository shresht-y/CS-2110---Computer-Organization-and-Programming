 * having a good idea of the kinds of helpers you can use will make it easier to
 * plan your code.
 *
 * None of these functions will be graded individually. However, implementing
 * and using these will make programming easier. We may provide ungraded test
 * cases for some of these functions after the assignment is released.

/* OPTIONAL HELPER FUNCTION: find_right
 * Given a pointer to a free block, this function searches the freelist for another block to the right of the provided block.

 * This function is provided for you by the TAs. You do not need to use it, but it may be helpful to you.
 * This function is the same as find_right, but for the other side of the newly freed block.
 * This function will be useful for my_free(), but it is also useful for my_malloc(), since whenever you sbrk a new block,
 * you need to merge it with the block at the back of the freelist if the blocks are next to each other in memory.

/* OPTIONAL HELPER FUNCTION: merge
 * This function should take two pointers to blocks and merge them together.
 * The most important step is to increase the total size of the left block to include the size of the right block.
 * You should also copy the right block's next pointer to the left block's next pointer. If both blocks are initially in the freelist, this will remove the right block from the list.

 * This function should take a pointer to a large block and a requested size, split the block in two, and return a pointer to the new block (the right part of the split).
 * Remember that you must make the right side have the user-requested size when splitting. The left side of the split should have the remaining data.
 * We recommend doing the following steps:
 * 1. Compute the total amount of memory that the new block will take up (both metadata and user data).
 * 2. Using the new block's total size with the address and size of the old block, compute the address of the start of the new block.
 * 3. Shrink the size of the old/left block to account for the lost size. This block should stay in the freelist.
 * 4. Set the size of the new/right block and return it. This block should not go in the freelist.
 * This function will be useful for my_malloc(), particularly when the best-fit block is big enough to be split.

 * Remember that the freelist must be sorted by address. You can compare the addresses of blocks by comparing the metadata_t pointers like numbers (do not dereference them).
 * Don't forget about the case where the freelist is empty. Remember what you learned from Homework 9.

// ------------------------- PART 2: Malloc functions -------------------------

/* Before starting each of these functions, you should:
 * 1. Understand what the function should do, what it should return, and what the freelist should look like after it finishes
 * 2. Develop a high-level plan for how to implement it; maybe sketch out pseudocode
 * 3. Check if the parameters have any special cases that need to be handled (when they're NULL, 0, etc.)
 * 4. Consider what edge cases the implementation needs to handle
 * 5. Think about any helper functions above that might be useful, and implement them if you haven't already

    // 3. If a block was not found:
    // 3.a. Call sbrk to get a new block.
    // 3.b. If sbrk fails (which means it returns -1), return NULL.
    // 3.c. If sbrk succeeds, add the new block to the freelist. If the new block is next to another block in the freelist, merge them.
    // 3.d. Go to step 2.
    // 4. If the block is too small to be split (see PDF for info regarding this), then remove the block from the freelist and return a pointer to the block's user section.
    // 5. If the block is big enough to split:
